<h1>Persona 4 Golden PC Edition Randomizer</h1>

<h3>Why this exists</h3>
<p>Randomizers are fun, and there's not really one for P4G on Windows that really randomizes everything, just encounters.</p>

<h3 id="warnings" style="color: red;">Warnings (PLEASE READ!)</h3>
<p>If you want to take full advantage of this mod, this must be the only one that you use (aside from any music mods). If you really want to use other mods with it (not recommended) make sure you put the randomizer at the LOWEST PRIORITY! This way, the majority of the randomizer files will still be copied to your <code>mods</code> directory but the mods on top will still be applied.
<br>
<p>Also, make sure to back up your saves often.</p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A Windows machine (if you use Linux, you don't need me to tell you what to do)</li>
  <li>A version of Persona 4 Golden <a href="https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13379">set up for modding</a></li>
  <li>Running <a href="link/dotnet.html">this installer</a> by downloading it and right clicking on it and pressing <code>Run with PowerShell</code></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/TGEnigma/preappfile/releases/latest/">TGE's Preapp File</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="beginner">Level 1 Crook Steps (<em>Noobs and Beginners should follow this!</em>)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Dump data_e into any folder you would like using Preapp File by dropping <code>data_e.cpk</code> from your P4G install onto the <code>preappfile.exe</code>, NOT INTO THE FOLDER, ON TOP OF THE EXE FILE</li>
  <li>Make sure the dump you created is named <code>data_e</code> and move it to your Documents folder</li>
  <li>Download <a href="https://swindlesmccoop.xyz/P4GPC-Randomizer/install.bat"><code>install.bat</code></a> by following the previous link. If it does not automatically download, you can download it by pressing <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>S</code>, and saving it as <code>install.bat</code>, NOT something like <code>install.bat.txt</code></li>
  <li>Go to where you downloaded the file and double click it</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions that it gives you</li>
  <li>Put the final output (when all of the black windows have disappeared) into wherever you load your mods from (Game install's <code>mods</code> folder, Aemulus, Mod Compendium, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3>What are unstable features?</h3>
<p>Features that might crash the game sometimes or have not been tested enough to have been added to the stable script.</p>
<h3>Does this work on Vita?</h3>
<p>lol u wish sucker</p>
<h3>Why did you shill for noobs by creating installer scripts?</h3>
<p>I had nothing else to do, and I <em>guess</em> it will expand the range of people who can use the randomizer without any knowledge of computers as well.</p>
