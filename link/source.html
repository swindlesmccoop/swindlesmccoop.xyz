<p>The Github repo is currently severely out of date.<br>
The CBPS domain mirror circumvents the CloudFlare protection on my email and whatnot, which would normally be downloaded if you used swindlesmccoop.xyz, but isn't code that I contributed. To get the raw source you must download from the CBPS mirror:</p>

<plaintext>
wget --recursive --domains swindlesmccoop.cbps.xyz --page-requisites swindlesmccoop.cbps.xyz
