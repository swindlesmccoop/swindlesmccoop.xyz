<p>SSMM is a new project that I'm working on that is a Simple Script Mod Manager. It will only use GNU CoreUtils and should run on any bash shell on any machine. It is currently being written as a <a href=https://fishshell.com/>Fish</a> script, but when I initialize the git repository, it will be written to work with pure bash with hopefully no prerequisites. It only uses grep, cat, echo, cp, mv, and other commands from the Unix days. Hopefully, I can set up something like <a href=https://git.swindlesmccoop.xyz>git.swindlesmccoop.xyz</a> in the near future, but for now I will probably try to host it on Github or a similar site. I wanted to buy <a href=https://git.moe>git.moe</a> but someone already owns it for their own stuff, so I might make a site that has to do with something similar that is still focused on git and not anything else (besides anime girls, of course).<br>
